# TravelJournal

###### This Android application helps you keep a travel log with the destinations you visit.

  In the main screen appears the list with the name of the destination, a picture that reflects that destination, as well as the period in which it was visited. When we click on a trip, a submenu will be included, including the type, price and rating added by us.

When we press the "+" button on the bottom right, we will be redirected to another window where we can add a new trip with the following details: name, destination, type, price, period and rating offered to that location.

When you click the "Save" button, the application will return us to the main menu where we will see that the trip has been added successfully.

In case we want to delete a trip, it is enough to long-press on it, and a confirmation window will appear on the screen.
