# TravelJournal

This Android application helps you keep a travel log with the destinations you visit.

In the main screen appears the list with the name of the destination, a picture that reflects that destination, as well as the period in which it was visited. When we click on a trip, a submenu will be included, including the type, price and rating added by us.
